The most common use of the <picture> element will be for art direction in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.

The <picture> element contains two tags: one or more <source> tags and one <img> tag.

The browser will look for the first <source> element where the media query matches the current viewport width, and then it will display the proper image (specified in the srcset attribute). The <img> element is required as the last child of the <picture> element, as a fallback option if none of the source tags matches.

The <title> tag is required in HTML documents!

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

    defines a title in the browser toolbar
    provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    displays a title for the page in search-engine results

Here are some tips for creating good titles:

    Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles)
    Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that
    Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results)

So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!
